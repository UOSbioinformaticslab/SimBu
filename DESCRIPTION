Title: Simulation and Batch Correction for Single-Cell RNA-Seq Data
Version: 0.1.0
Authors@R: c(
    person(given = "Steph", family = "Ritchie", email = "s.ritchie@sussex.ac.uk", role = c("aut", "cre"))
)
Description: Tools to simulate single-cell RNA-seq count data with controllable
    batch effects and biological structure, and to benchmark batch correction
    and integration workflows. Provides functions to (1) generate synthetic
    expression matrices under varying assumptions; (2) introduce batch-, library
    size-, and cell typeâ€“specific effects; (3) apply and compare multiple batch
    correction and integration methods; and (4) compute quantitative metrics to
    assess correction performance and biological signal preservation. Designed
    to facilitate reproducible evaluation of normalization, integration, and
    downstream analysis pipelines.
