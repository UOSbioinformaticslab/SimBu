Title: Simulation and Batch Correction for Single-Cell RNA-Seq Data
Version: 0.1.0

)
Description: Tools to simulate single-cell RNA-seq count data with controllable
    batch effects and biological structure, and to benchmark batch correction
    and integration workflows. Provides functions to: (1) generate synthetic
    expression matrices under varying assumptions; (2) introduce batch-,
    library size-, and cell typeâ€“specific effects; (3) apply and compare
    multiple batch correction / integration methods; and (4) compute
    quantitative metrics to assess correction performance and biological
    signal preservation. Designed to facilitate reproducible evaluation of
    normalization, integration, and downstream analysis pipelines.
